    Downtime is more critical for certain customers                                                                                    DOWNTIME
    Acceptance testing is performed by both the company and the customers                                                              ACCEPTANCE TESTING
    Software is often integrated to multiple third party applications                                                                  THIRD PARTY APPLICATIONS
    Software is often accompanied by multiple external components                                                                      COMPONENTS
    There exists multiple different configurations due to having multiple customers with different specifications                      CONFIGURATIONS
    Transferring the software product to diverse customer-owned environments requires different deployment configurations              TRANSFERRING

Procedure

    UAT environment is a requisite for production release                                               ACCEPTANCE TESTING
    The development process drifts towards small feature branches from long-lived feature branches      SMALL FEATURES
	Triggering the compilation and deployment of large, modular projects                   TRIGGERING
	The software has to be deployed to multiple customers                                  MULTIPLE ENVIRONMENTS
	Versioning is affected by having different customer profiles of the product            VERSIONING
	Responsibility moves towards developers                                                RESPONSIBLITITY

Customer

    Customers are trained to use a certain UI                                              TRAINING
    Customers are reluctant towards new versions                                           RELUCTANCY
    Changelogs are especially important, since customers depend on the software            CHANGELOG
    Pilot customer is required for developing the continuous delivery process              PILOT
	Production deployment schedule has to be negotiated with the customer                  PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT
	Ongoing critical tasks by users cannot be interrupted with downtime                    DOWNTIME

CE

Tech

    Not having a UI limits the scope of experiments in CDM   
    Low end-user volume limits experiments that rely on statistical significance    
	CDM is only usable via API calls, which limits the scope of experiments   
	Measurable metrics for the software products are not extensively identified    
	Experimental architecture has to be implemented on top of a matured project   
	Data has to be collected in customer environments   

Organization

    Requirements by customers bring in revenue, and are prioritized over own product development   
    Competence in experimentation is not high, and requires education   
    Transitioning towards experimentation culture affects other teams, including sales   
    Creating a culture of innovation within the organization   
    
Customer

    Large part of developed features are requirements from customers   
	Customers perform routine tasks that cannot be interrupted   
	Customers have to be informed for major changes   
	Technical personnel aren't involved in customer interaction   
	The software has to undergo testing in the UAT before production release   
	The end-users might be customers' customers, complicating feedback collection   
	A pro-active lead customer is required to develop the experimentation process   
	Proper legal agreements need to be made with the customers to collect data   	

A/B

    Low end-user volume limits the scopes of experiments   
	CDM is used by integrated systems instead of human users   
	CDM has user no interface to tune   
    Measurable metrics for A/B testing are not extensively identified   
	Users have been educated to use certain features, and changing these confuses the users
