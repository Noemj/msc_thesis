The paper attempts to investigate continuous experimentation in the context of Customer Development process. The abstract fails to elaborate the research question, research approach or the contents of the paper apart from the topic - a short peek of the contents is then provided in the introduction chapter. The introduction chapter could, however, give a deeper analysis on both the contents and the results of the paper. As the article is probably unfinished, please take this feedback as constructive criticism instead of plain criticism. 

The article is currently heavily lacking in citations. It is unclear what is the authors own contribution and what are the known facts. The structure of the article isn't very straightforward, but instead feels very clustered. An example is the Company Building chapter - it's very hard for the reader to stay on track when the text is structured in such way. There are also many figures without any references to them. 

As the topic includes continuous experimentation, it should probably be discussed about in more detail. It definitely has to be presented in detail as well. Now it's only mentioned a couple of times, and connected to Customer Development only at the conclusion chapter. The third chapter is probably just a draft, and contains a lot of information with no connections. A discussion chapter should probably be added, in which the author further elaborates the main research question, which should also be stated somewhere. A scientific paper which deals with continuous experimentation is also necessary.

All in all the paper is still a skeleton of a proper seminar paper, but as the topic is interesting and the linquistic form is good I expect this to improve a lot.
