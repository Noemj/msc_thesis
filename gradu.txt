Re-engineering development process to radically streamline it and allow experimentation in B2B software development

- Another objective is to manage customer specific or 
experimentational parts of software to enable more flexible 
development 
o Managing customer variability and experimenting 
features without compromising core functionality. These 
customer specific and experimental parts may become 
part of the core product later based on the analysis of 
experimentation results

Task 3: Investigate and adopt tools that enable closing the gap between 
specification, planning, development, testing and documenting
-research questions?

topic idea (rough)

-Collecting feedback in a B2B environment
-Selecting user stories based on the big picture
-How to validate assumptions about the impact of user stories <- Most interesting out of these ideas. People responsible for giving the user stories answer to the question "How can it be done" instead of "What is to be done" or "Why should this be done".
-How to measure progress / success of development?

ideas

There are already alot of processes for use case development. It's not really a research problem.
Connect backlogs to business context!

Questions

main challenges?

-The time between the idea and implementation is too long. Accelerating this process by even 10% could double the profit, by both spending less time on the project and having the feature on the market faster. How to filter ideas and decide which ideas should be implemented? How good ideas bypass bad ideas? 

-The items in the backlog often aren't detached objects, but instead there's a dependency between multiple objects. How to determine the key items?

-Time dimension. If an impact is done right now, when will the effects be visible?

-Conventions for production deployment. The whole pipe between the idea and implementation isn't yet completely perceived. Some parts are visible, but the entirety is still unclear.

-How to measure progress / success?

-Ideasta toteutukseen kuluva aika on liian pitkä
-10% nopeutus voi tuplata tuoton
-Malli "mihin kysymyksiin voi vastata?"
-Miten filteroida projektit ja päättää menevätkö ne etenpäin?
-Miten hyvät ideat ohittavat huonoja ideoita?
-Investointilaskelmia?
-Aikadimensio. Jos teen impaktin nyt, milloin tulee vaikutus?
-Mitä käytäntöjä tuotantoonvientiin? Kuinka hahmottaa koko putki? Osia löytyy, kokonaisuus epäselvä.

Where's the biggest pain?
-How to measure progress / success?
-Backlogin itemit eivät ole irrallisia, vaan niissä on riippuvuus. Mitkä ovat avainjuttuja?

	Feature injection
-Business analysis process framework that allows teams to exploit the value of traditional business analysis techniques in projects involving frequent iterative deliveries.
-Goal is to link the business analyst community with the agile development community.
-Allows a business analyst to participate in lean projects.
-Helps agile teams to benefit form just enough analysis and just in time.
Steps
1. Hunt the value
2. Inject the features
3. Stop the examples

Effect mapping
-

Impact mapping
-Sounds a bit like GQM to me
-Based on mind maps
Answers to questions such as
-Why are we developing this? Whats the goal?
-Who are the main stakeholders in reaching the goal?
-How stakeholders can help us to achieve our goal?
-What do we have to do that aforementioned questions help us achieve our goals?
User story mapping

Continuous experimentation

From steeri:

test cases
which results are expected?

10.1.2014
=========
How does our company produce value to customers?
How does our customer provide value to their customer?

Which results are expected?
-Seeking value from customers
*Process specifications (Framework, concepts. Top-down).
*Description / POC for tools

*How to identify features that provide value to the customers?
>Items in the backlog should be valuable to the customer

*Prioritising tasks based on the value they provide
>How many customers would benefit from the same solution

*When a feature is described, we should estimate how much it benefits a customer and how a customer would use it

*Instead of a snapshot, the model should be modifiable

-Re-engineering ..
*Probably more architectural question

22.1.2014
*Pipeline: version control -> ci -> validation -> deployment ?
