% --- Template for thesis / report with tktltiki2 class ---
% 
% last updated 2013/02/15 for tkltiki2 v1.02

\documentclass[english]{tktltiki2}

% tktltiki2 automatically loads babel, so you can simply
% give the language parameter (e.g. finnish, swedish, english, british) as
% a parameter for the class: \documentclass[finnish]{tktltiki2}.
% The information on title and abstract is generated automatically depending on
% the language, see below if you need to change any of these manually.
% 
% Class options:
% - grading                 -- Print labels for grading information on the front page.
% - disablelastpagecounter  -- Disables the automatic generation of page number information
%                              in the abstract. See also \numberofpagesinformation{} command below.
%
% The class also respects the following options of article class:
%   10pt, 11pt, 12pt, final, draft, oneside, twoside,
%   openright, openany, onecolumn, twocolumn, leqno, fleqn
%
% The default font size is 11pt. The paper size used is A4, other sizes are not supported.

%
% The following commands define the information used to generate title and
% abstract pages. The following entries should be always specified:

\title{Extending the “Development Pipeline” Towards Continuous Deployment and Continuous Experimentation: A Case Study in the B2B Domain}
\author{Olli Rissanen}
\date{\today}
\level{Master's thesis}
\abstract{Abstract.}

% The following can be used to specify keywords and classification of the paper:

\keywords{Continuous delivery, Continuous experimentation, Development pipeline}

% classification according to ACM Computing Classification System (http://www.acm.org/about/class/)
% This is probably mostly relevant for computer scientists
% uncomment the following; contents of \classification will be printed under the abstract with a title
% "ACM Computing Classification System (CCS):"
% \classification{}

% If the automatic page number counting is not working as desired in your case,
% uncomment the following to manually set the number of pages displayed in the abstract page:
%
% \numberofpagesinformation{16 pages + 10 appendix pages}
%
% If you are not a computer scientist, you will want to uncomment the following by hand and specify
% your department, faculty and subject by hand:
%
\faculty{Faculty of Science}
\department{Department of Computer Science}
\subject{Computer Science}
%
% If you are not from the University of Helsinki, then you will most likely want to set these also:
%
\university{University of Helsinki}
% \universitylong{HELSINGIN YLIOPISTO --- HELSINGFORS UNIVERSITET --- UNIVERSITY OF HELSINKI} % displayed on the top of the abstract page
\city{Helsinki}

It’s hard to argue that Tiger Woods is pretty darn good at what he does. But even he is not perfect. Imagine if
he were allowed to hit four balls each time and then choose the shot that worked the best. Scary good.

% --- References ---
%
% bibtex is used to generate the bibliography. The babplain style
% will generate numeric references (e.g. [1]) appropriate for theoretical
% computer science. If you need alphanumeric references (e.g [Tur90]), use
%
% \bibliographystyle{babalpha-lf}
%
% instead.

\bibliographystyle{babplain-lf}
\bibliography{gradu}
