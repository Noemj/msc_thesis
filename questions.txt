in a case study results should be based at least on some measured data. what should be measured in this case? qualitative? 
-old data is available, such as efforts for projects. can it be used if no new methods are implemented?

Objective—what to achieve? 
-Exploratory / improving? conclusions have to be made from qualitative or quantitative measurements.

The case—what is studied? 
-current practice / new practice? without implementation? 
-the solution should probably be described but not implemented?

Research questions—what to know?
-again, without implementation just speculations?

Methods-how to collect data?
-qualitative? interviews?

Selection strategy—where to seek data?
-employees?


-look for existing case studies (check paper links, se journals)
