A normal template for a study would be to measure the current situation, implement changes and then measure the situation afterwards. 
In my study how do we sort of validate that something is actually important without actually implementing anything?

What's your opinion on the current interview questions?
What's your opinion on the current research questions?
Along with the interview, I could implement a survey to measure the pains in the current process. Is that a good idea?


The interview questions seem to mainly address issues related to the development process. How to address the technical side and technical research questions? Should these be dropped? In my opinion the literature review attempts to answer the technical questions. Should the interview questions dig deeper in the technical side?
